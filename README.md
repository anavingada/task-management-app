# Task management app project

This project is a task management application similar to Trello.
It allows to add and edit tasks, as well as move them around between to do, in progress and done.

This project is built with Vue3, Typescript, Vite and TailwindCss. It uses packages such as vuedraggable and focus-trap.

## Recommended IDE Setup

To locally run the project, please download the zip file and open it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Please install the plugin [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) and disable the plugin Vetur.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

As TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, the `tsc` CLI was replaced by `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, such as VSCode, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

Please visit [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for customization.
